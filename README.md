# Agência OSS - Landing Page
A clean and conversion-driven landing page created for my former digital agency, Agência OSS. The site focused on offering clear, result-oriented digital services to local businesses using Google’s ecosystem.

## About the Project
This project was designed to communicate a straightforward offer: helping local businesses attract more clients through tools like Google Ads, smart websites, and Google Business Profile optimization.

It presents a simplified version of our service structure, introduces the agency's methodology, and drives leads through a free consultation call-to-action.

The goal was not to showcase visual complexity, but to communicate clarity, credibility, and practical value to small business owners — especially those less familiar with digital tools.

## Design Choices
- Focused on **clear offer messaging** and step-by-step explanation of services
- Strong **positioning around results** and expertise with Google platforms
- Single CTA repeated across sections: **Book a Free Consultation**
- Visual hierarchy based on contrast and space, no heavy visual distractions
- Built for **fast reading and fast contact**
